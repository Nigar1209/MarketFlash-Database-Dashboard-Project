## Project Summary

Through the MarketFlash project, I transformed redundant data into a structured database and interactive dashboard, providing actionable insights into marketing campaign performance. The project involved data normalization, relational database design, and the creation of a comprehensive Tableau dashboard, equipping MarketFlash with the tools for strategic marketing decisions.

## Recommendations

- **Increase Investment in TikTok and Facebook:** These channels delivered the highest conversions (116K and 108K respectively), indicating strong ROI potential.
- **Target Known Gender Segments:** Since 43.1% of conversions have unknown gender, enhancing user tracking could improve personalization; currently, Male (29%) slightly outperforms Female (27.8%).
- **Focus on High-Performing Regions:** Allocate more campaigns to the Japan, Europe, and UKâ€”these regions show strong engagement and campaign volume.
- **Optimize for Seasonal Trends:** Leverage periods like March and June, where conversion rates historically peaked, for campaign launches or budget boosts.
- **Improve Data Quality:** Reduce the high percentage of unknown gender and potentially underreported metrics to enable more precise targeting.
